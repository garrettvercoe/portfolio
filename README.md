### Overview
This repository holds my portfolio built with Gatsby, managed by Prismic CMS, and designed using a 4-grid modular system.
It's main idea is that all work is valuable, and serves as an archive for projects both big and small. It helps to show a clear through-line of my work as an engineer, artist, and designer over time. 

### Features
Gatsby: Front-end framework for building fast, reliable websites.
Prismic CMS: Content is managed and updated in Prismic.
4 Grid Modular Design System: Enhances UI consistency and scalability.
Auto-Rebuild: Any CMS updates trigger an automatic rebuild of the site.

### Setup
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Run gatsby develop to start the dev site.

### Deployment
The site rebuilds and deploys automatically when the CMS content is updated.

Feel free to fork it and take inspiration for your own horizontal portfolio.
